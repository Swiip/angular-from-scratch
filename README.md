#Angular from scratch

*Work in progress*

This repository contains all the content needed for the Angular from scratch workshop created by [@olivierhuber](https://twitter.com/olivierhuber) and [@Swiip](https://twitter.com/Swiip).

This workshop has been inspired by some blog posts on the internet and especially [Make Your Own AngularJS, Part 1: Scopes And Digest](http://teropa.info/blog/2013/11/03/make-your-own-angular-part-1-scopes-and-digest.html). The blogger [@teropa](https://twitter.com/teropa) started the adaptation of the concept on an eBook which can only recommend [Build Your Own AngularJS](http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular).
